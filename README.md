# SEAL Challenge

This is our software solution for the 2023 SEAL Challenge. We utilized an HDMI feed coming off a DJI Mavic 2 Pro to run continuous QR Code detection. We also utilized a pair of ESP32 with a ESPNow connection between them to control a dropper mechanism. The software sends a servo angle over USB Serial to an ESP32 which then transmits to the dropper mechanis on the drone.
